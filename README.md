A tiny and delightful library for manipulating objects.
> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: I'm working on v2 with a different API, The current API (v1.1) will become deprecated. The old API is available on branch `v1`.
## Feauters
- No dependencies _(at least for now)_
- Fast and lightweight ⚡️
# Installation
**v2 is not published yet**, but it'll be available as `@hkh12/xobj`.
```sh
npm install @hkh12/xobj
```
## Usage
```js
// `x_` is an alias to xobj
const x_ = require('@hkh12/xobj')
```
**For a full list of methods, visit [here](docs/README.md).**
